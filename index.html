      <h3 class="navy">Summary</h3>

      <h3 class="navy">Technical Details</h3>
      <p>For front end development I leverage React, SASS, and a whole host of npm modules such as Redux, RxJS, and more daily. Recently I have been focusing on writing Javascript in a purely functional style as much as possible. I also have extensive experience with Angular, LESS, and HTML5. I generally build my codebases to using npm for task management, but I have experience with Gulp and Grunt as well.</p>
      <p>For UI/UX prototyping I prefer to use Invision to quickly create something that can be manipulated. Leveraging both Sketch for production quality prototypes and simple paper sketching for quick low fidelity prototypes. In addition I have extensive Photoshop experience.</p>
      <p>For back-end development I have near 12 years of experience in PHP as well as some experience with Python and Ruby. Within the last two years all of my back-end code and scripting has been done in Node.js or bash.</p>
      <h3 class="navy">Experience</h3>
      <h4 class="mb0 navy">Effective UI, Denver - <em>Senior Technical Lead & Developer</em></h4>
      <h5 class="mt0 blue uppercase">2015 - Present</h5>
      <p>My initial project at Effective UI involved leading a team in developing a single page application using Angular to chart statistics for a the criminal justice system. In addition to leveraging Angular we were the first team at the company to write exclusively in ES6, as well as leverage D3 for rendering maps and data visualizations. Over time I moved into a lead architect role, becoming the primary React developer for the organization, in addition to leading an initiative to involve development more actively in the UX and solution side of the agency.</p>
      <h4 class="mb0 navy">303 Software, Denver - <em>Senior Developer</em></h4>
      <h5 class="mt0 blue uppercase">2014 - 2015</h5>
      <p>While at 303 Software I worked exclusively with the MEAN stack, creating two application front-ends and a REST API. I lead the way in recreating the company’s approach to agile application development, demonstrating how a lead developer can leverage rapid prototyping and provide system architecture to ensure that projects stay on track and reach minimum viable product more quickly. Unfortunately the company was forced to lay off a significant number of employees, myself included.</p>
      <h4 class="mb0 navy">Insight Designs, Boulder - <em>Senior Developer</em></h4>
      <h5 class="mt0 blue uppercase">2013 - 2014</h5>
      <p>Insight Designs was a company with about fifteen employees, I worked on a variety of projects ranging from small static sites to large Magento-based ecommerce sites. My primary focus was extending WooCommerce and the WooCommerce Subscription extension for The Feed’s unique subscription model.</p>
      <h4 class="mb0 navy">Previous Experience - <em>Various Development Roles</em></h4>
      <h5 class="mt0 blue uppercase">1999-2013</h5>
      <p>Starting in high school I worked for various small town agencies while living in Alabama, including a position with a law firm in Montgomery. During this time I became proficient in PHP, which led to a five year stint in Boulder with Stormlab, which sadly went out of business. Later during this time I moved into contract work, primarily WordPress, while going back to school for my associate degree in Mathematics.</p>
