        <!-- About & Interests -->
        <!-- Paragraph or two. -->
        <p>Although the future is never set in stone, one thing is constant, I am always looking for the next **problem to solve**. More than any technology stack, specific design paradigm, or team management technique, **curiosity** and a **drive to do good work** define what I am looking for in a new position. Looking at a problem that needs solving, defining the user stories, experimenting with the correct technology stack, and building out a kick-ass solution is what I have to offer.</p>
